# Arma 3 Viper Dawn

### Summary

It's 30 years later and the ghosts of the Apex war return. The toxic swamps of Tanoa become the battleground for the 2nd Vietnam War. 
NATO's only choice is to thaw out Captain Miller, the man they put in Cryo-prison for a crime he didn't commit. 
Through the jungles and hills Miller must battle his way past blood thirsty Syndikat cannibals, mutated animals and deadly acid snakes to reach Viper base.

There he will face his old nemesis, General Fang. Who commands Viper force, an elite army of super soldiers. Equipped with latest weaponry from communist China. Along the way Miller will encounter some old friends and new allies to help him defeat Fang's forces.

This is Viper Dawn!

### Gameplay

Gameplay will be first person, with a simplified Arma 3 interface to encourage an arcade feel to the mod. 
Visuals will be done as much through postfx and simple texture mods to achieve an authentic retro action ambience.
Miller will have a linear progression as he campaigns across the Tanoa wasteland,
Health will be managed by a script with basic auto healing along with the ability to heal yourself with resupplies.
Weapons will be tweaked to increase fire rate and explosiveness but reduced accuracy.


### Main goals

* Retexture Viper forces in a new scheme
* Ambience scripts for Tanoa (fires, radiation, smoke, ruins)
* Post processing effects, magenta haze etc
* Miller retexture for Cyborg-Miller!
* Basic mission to start off with, leading into a campaign that can be developed later
* Soundtrack [Retro Synth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovzRrrLvW1M_)
* Confuse the player as much as possible and possibly give them epilepsy


### Extra goals

* Dialogue and voice recordings
* Branding
* Custom weapon models and vehicles

Any suggestions or mods that can help out, please let me know!
